Quiz #6

Exercise #1:

Study Test Output (Not graded)

Simply run some tests and study the output. Make sure you know where to find information on the
cause of a failed test. Remember, there are usually several ways to obtain the required information.
Spend some time getting to know them all, so you can choose the one which suits you best.

Exercise #2: 

Debugging Session (Not graded)

Make yourself comfortable with the debugging of tests. Using your favorite IDE, set some breakpoints
(in test code and in the source code of the tested classes) and execute some tests. Practise working
through all the typical scenarios of a debugging session:
• setting breakpoints,
• getting information on the values of variables,
• various types of moving forward (step into, step over, etc.).
